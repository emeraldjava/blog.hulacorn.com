## Introduction

The process of creating software can be complex. There are many moving parts. In 20+ years of working, I have observed that engineers sometimes live in a system where many constraints, requirements and ways of working are unrelated to coding and building products. My favourite is the "estimation game", where you spend hours and weeks guessing when something will be done through various ceremonies. There are [many articles](http://noestimates.org/blog/) on why this approach of guessing when a feature will be in production does not work.

# Votes.hulacorn.com

Many of our ideas on votes.Hulacorn.com are focused on helping engineers have a better time at work. We are running an experiment on this site where folks can vote for their problems. 
We received 172 votes across all our ideas in the last three months.

# Results

The top-voted problem was people wanted to stop estimating features. Knowing this, we have decided to narrow our focus more here at Hulacorn and solve the problem of calculating when the software will be in production. 

# Epilogue 
We will continue building in public, sharing what we learn.
